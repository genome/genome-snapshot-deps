TL;DR
=====

vim lucid/genome-snapshot-deps-perl
bin/dch lucid
git commit
make lucid
tgi-dput -r genome-snapshot-deps_*.changes

How to Add New Dependencies
===========================

- Add the dependency to the appropriate meta-package list in the distro directory, e.g. genome-snapshot-deps-perl.
- Update the changelog in the distro directory by running `bin/dch $DISTRO`.
- Commit your changes.

How to Build
============

All you have to do is run `make lucid` this will generate the N debs and a changes file in the parent folder.

How to Add New Meta-packages
============================

- Make a new dependency list with the meta-package's name in the distro directory.
- Add a case in bin/build-control similar to the existing ones but change the Depends or Description as needed.
- Add that new meta-package as a dependency of genome-snapshot-deps in bin/build-control.

How to Add a New Distro
=======================

You should only need to make a new distro if the are dependency differences between them. We may want to re-evaluate how to do this in the case of multiple distros.

- Add a case in bin/build-control to use your distro's debhelper version.
- For convenience, setup a rule in the Makefile. See the lucid rule.
